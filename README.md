# CSINTSY - State Based Model
This project involves developing a Python program to simulate optimal pathfinding on a specified map. The program will utilize the A* algorithm, a heuristic search approach, to find the most efficient path from a starting point to a goal.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

    1. Open a New Terminal:
         On Windows: Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
         On macOS: Press Cmd + Space, type Terminal, and press Enter.
         On Linux: Open your terminal emulator from the applications menu.
    
    2. Navigate to the Source Folder:
        cd Source

    3. Run the Script:
        to run the A* algorithm script, use: python astar_search.py
      
Heuristic Search Guidelines:

    1. Enter the start city when prompted. Ensure the city is available in the graph.
    2. Enter the goal city when prompted. Ensure the city is available in the graph.
    3. Enter the heuristic values for each city except the goal city. Heuristic values should be numeric.
    4. The program will compute and display the optimal path and total cost from the start city to the goal city.
    5. If no path is found, the program will inform you accordingly.
